# Projecto

A project management system with web application. Built with Angular.

## How to run project

- Make sure you have Node.js version >=14.0.0 and npm package manager installed. For installation help, see this [downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) page.
  > To check your Node.js version, type `node -v` in command line.  
  > To check your npm version, type `npm -v` in command line.
- Fork and clone repository
  > Or you could instead download the code with a ZIP file. To do this go to [this project's main GitHub page](https://github.com/SvetlaGeorgieva/projecto-angular), click on the "Code" button. A drop-down menu will appear, select "Download ZIP".
- Open new terminal in project's root folder
- Run `npm install` -> to install all dependencies
- Run `npm start` OR `ng serve` -> to start dev server
- The app will be running on port 4200  
   [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)
  > Alternatively you can run `ng serve -o` and it will automatically open the app in a browser ðŸ˜‰
