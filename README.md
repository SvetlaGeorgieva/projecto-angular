# Projecto

A project management system with web application. Built with Angular.

## How to run project

- Make sure you have Node.js version >=14.0.0 and npm package manager installed. For installation help, see this [downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) page.
- Fork and clone repository
  > Or you could also download the code with a ZIP file. To do this, click on the "Code" button, a drop-down menu will appear, select "Download ZIP".
- Open new terminal in project's root folder
- Run `npm install` -> to install all dependencies
- Run `npm start` OR `ng serve` -> to start dev server
- The app will be running on port 4200  
   [http://127.0.0.1:4200/](http://127.0.0.1:4200/)
  > Alternatively you can run `ng serve -o` and it will automatically open the app in a browser ðŸ˜‰

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
